					blessings of the Lord to improve the divinity of the holy place.

While the Jeernodhara work of the temple is in good progress, it has been the urge of the devotees to go for the reconstruction of temples simultaneously. 

Owing to the desire of the devotees, Shree K.P.Shinivasa TANTRY has consented for the reconstruction of various temples. 

In the past also, the Jeernodhdhara or renovation of temples was carried out by his ancistors since they belong to the well known family of  "Tantry", who plays a major wole in the renovation of temples.


The Jeernodhara will be commenced with Kalasankocha vidhi and Balalaya Pratisthapana of the God along with the presiding deities of that religious place.

The existing temple is being dismantled for the same.Foundation stone for the proposed math building will be laid.

<div class="col-md-12"><h2 class="text-center" style="color:white;">Need Of Renovation of temples</h2>
<p  class="text-justify"> The holy abode of the Lord is enshrined in the existing structure which is believed to be about centuries old and required 
renovation technically called as “Jeernoddhara” which has been implemented in accordance with the tenets of the Shastras by seeking guidance from the 
religious heads.It is needless to emphasize that Jeernoddhara is a major task requiring coordinated efforts from the various sections of the Samaj by 
evolving plans of systematic execution of each part of the project in consultation with engineers, architects and other resource persons of expertise 
for proper accomplishment within a minimum time frame. For this purpose the Council of Trustees was entrusted with the required authority and responsibility 
of evolving measures for coordinated efforts by constituting a suitable Committee with well defined functions of properly organizing the renovation works and 
the Council of the Temple has thus formed the Committee.<br/>
The Jeernoddhara Committee will take an auspicious start by receiving the divine blessings of the Swamijis, Matadhipathis.
The relevant drawings denoting the reconstruction works are furnished herein separately. The works include granite construction, teak wood work,
 copper roofings, golden Kalasha on the top of the Garbhagriha,Dhwajasthambha and so on.
