     Yantras are usually associated with a particular deity and are used for specific benefits, such as: for meditation; protection from harmful influences; development of particular powers; attraction of wealth or success, etc.they are often used in daily ritual worship at home or in temples, and sometimes worn as a talisman.
Various geometric shapes and images, along with written mantras, form the yantra. triangles and hexagrams are common, along with circles and lotuses of 4 to 1,000 petals. saiva and shakta yantras often include prongs of a trident.yantra designs in modern times have deviated from the traditional patterns given in ancient texts and traditions. shops in india and nepal will often copy designs from western imitations of yantras or artistic representations that may have originated from the traditional designs.



</p> 
<h2 class="text-center" style="color:white;">How do YANTRA work ?</h2>
<p  class="text-justify">At the basis of yantra operation is something called “shape energy” or “form energy”. the idea is that every shape emits a very specific frequency and energy pattern. examples of old believes in shape energy are the yantras and mandalas of eastern philosophies, the star of david, the five pointed star (pentagon), the christian cross, the pyramids and so on. certain ‘powers’ are ascribed to the various shapes. some have ‘evil’ or negative energies and some ‘good’ or positive energies, but in yantra yoga only the beneficial and harmonious energies are used.when one focuses on a yantra, his mind is atomatically “tuned in” by resonance into the specific form energy of that yantra. the process of resonance is then maintained and amplified. the yantra acts only as a “tune in” mechanism or a doorway. the subtle energy does not come from the yantra itself, but from the macrocosm.
<br/>Basically  yantras are secret keys for establishing resonance with the beneficial energies of the macrocosm. very often the yantras can put us in contact with extremely elevated energies and entities, being of invaluable help on the spiritual path.
<br/>Gods in turn grace men with plenty of wealth and physical comforts. we can observe a miniature of this god concept in yanthra vidya. among the various yanthras, ‘sreechakram’ is the most important one. varying saktheya powers are unitedly brought in to a chakra (circular carving) and worshipped. powerful presence of devi is obvious at each corner of sreechakra. presence of lalitha parameswari, goddess showering all prosperities, make sreechakra more powerful and effective. sudarshana chakra manifests the divine power of lord vishnu. yanthras belong to various classes in concern with the deity. there are saktheya yanthras like vishnu yanthra, shiva yanthra, ganapathy yanthra, sree yanthra, thara yanthra, bala yanthra and aswarooda yanthra, mruthyunjaya and aghora belong to shaiva class. santhana gopala, narasimha are vaishnava yanthras, vasheekarana, marana (death) yanthras are also popular. yanthras inscribed on copper, silver or golden sheets, offered with magic spells of concerned deity and wearing or installing in the proper way, undoubtedly bring great results. yanthras materialise humanly desire and bring ultimate ‘moksha’ to the devotee. all the hundred verses ‘soundarya lehari’ represent hundred yanthras. in the explanatory notes for ‘soundarya lahari’ by kantiyoor mahadev sasthri, there are descriptions of all such yanthras and way of wearing them in detail. yanthras are much utilized in kerala as a part of manthravada. they are also worn by devotees for the easy recovery from deadly deceases. yanthras have undoubtedly the capability to control mind. for a pious person, wearing appropriate yanthra, offering worship with due dedication and leading a sacred life, it is possible to attain both physical and spiritual prosperity. ohm shanthi : shanthi :shanthi:</p>
<h2 class="text-center" style="color:white;">Concept Of  Yantra:</h2>
<p  class="text-justify">Every yantra is delimited from the exterior by a line or a group of lines forming its perimeter. these marginal lines have the function to maintain, contain and prevent the loss of the magical forces represented by the core structure of the yantra, usually the central dot. they also have the function to increase its magical and subtle force.The core of the YANTRA is composed of one or several simple geometrical shapes : dots, lines, triangles, squares, Every yantra is delimited from the exterior by a line or a group of lines forming its perimeter. these marginal lines have the function to maintain, contain and prevent the loss of the magical forces represented by the core structure of the yantra, usually the central dot. they also have the function to increase its magical and subtle force.The core of the YANTRA is composed of one or several simple geometrical shapes : dots, lines, triangles, squares, </p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Dot (bindu)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify">    For example the dot (bindu) signifies the focalized energy and its intense concentration. it can be evnisaged as a kind of energy deposit which can in turn radiate energy under other forms. the dot is usually surrounded by different surfaces, either a triangle, a hexagon, a circle etc. these forms depend on the characteristic of the deity or aspect represented by the yantra. in the tantric iconography, the dot is named bindu; in tantrabindu is symbolically considered to be shiva himself, the source of the whole creation.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Triangle (Trikona)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify">The triangle (trikona) is the symbol of shakti, the feminine energy or aspect of creation. the triangle pointing down represents the yoni, the feminine sexual organ and the symbol of the supreme source of the universe, and when the triangle is pointing upwards it signifies intense spiritual aspiration, the sublimation of one’s nature into the most subtle planes and the element of fire (agni tattva). the fire is always oriented upwards, thus the correlation with the upward triangle – shiva kona. on the other hand, the downward pointing triangle signifies the element of water which always tends to flown and occupy the lowest possible position. this triangle is known as shakti kona.The intersection of two geometric forms (lines, triangles, circles, etc.) represents forces that are even more intense than those generated by the simple forms. such an interpenetration indicates a high level in the dynamic interaction of the correspondent energies. the empty spaces generated by such combinations are described as very efficient operational fields of the forces emanating from the centeral point of the yantra. that is why we can very often encounter representations of mantras in such spaces. yantra and mantra are complementary aspects of shiva and their use together is much more efficient than the use of one alone.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Six-Pointed Star (shatkona)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify">A typical combination often found in the graphical structure of a yantra is the superposition of two triangles, one pointing upwards and the other downwards, forming a star with six points (shatkona), also known as david’s star. this form symbolically represents the union of purusha and prakriti or shiva-shakti, without which there could be no creation.</p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Circle (chakra)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify">    Another simple geometrical shape often used in yantras is the circle, representing the rotation, a movement closely linked to the shape of spiral which is fundamental in the macrocosmic evolution. at the same time, the circle represents perfection and the blissful creative void. in the series of the five fundamental elements it represents air (vayu tattva).</p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Square (bhupura)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify"> Between the simple geometrical elemets that compose yantras there is also the sqaure (bhupura). the square is usually the exterior limit of the yantra and symbolically, it represents the element earth (prithivi tattva).
Every yantra starts from the center, often marked by a central dot (bindu) and ends with the outer square. this represents the sense of universal evolution, starting from the subtle and ending with the coarse, starting from “ether” and ending with “earth”.
Even tough most of the times yantras are composed of these simple geometrical shapes, sometimes we encounter other elements such as arrow points, tridents, swords, spikes included in the design of a yantra with the purpose of representing vectors and directions of action for the yantric energies.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center" style="color:white;">The Lotus (padma)</h3>
<p  class="text-justify">     The lotus symbol (or its petals) is both a symbol of purity and variety, every lotus petal representing a distinct aspect. the inclusion of a lotus in a yantra represents freedom from multiple interference with the exterior (purity) and expresses the absolute force of the supreme self.
In conclusion, a yantra is a very complex spiritual instrument in the tantric practice (sadhana). it can calm and focus the activities of the mind, and by its positive auto-suggestion it has a beneficial impact on the health and psychic well being of a person.
A yantra alone represents nothing. only when it is awakened by mental concentration and meditation will the process of resonance appear and the beneficial macrocosmic energies will manifest themselves in the practitioner’s microcosm.
preparation of yanthra is based on baahya pooja system. yanthra is drawn on flat background . bhoorjapathra, palm leaf, betel leaf or panchaloha is selected for the purpose. yanthras vary widely in accordance with the nature and characteristics of deity, magic spells used for each deity and the purpose for which the yanthra prepared. lines and angles in an yanthra may not exactly agree with the concepts of geometry. surface on which yanthra is drawn is considered to be prapancha (universe) or kshetra. at the centre karnika is drawn which is supposed to be source of origin of life. centre point of karnika, angles, dalas, circles, bhoopuras are drawn then. karnika (centre point) is interpreted in different ways- ananda maya kosham, akasathmakam, bimbam, creation, life etc. likerise anles (thrikona, shatkon etc) are supposed as sphere of intellect (vinjnanamaya kosham) atmosphere inner sphere, stale of being and life. dalas or padmas are interpreted as ‘manomayakosham’. ‘thejomandalam’, madhyahara, smhara and intellect. circles (vritham) represent ‘pranamayakosham’. water, bahirhara disappearance (thirodhanam) and proudness ( ahankarathmakam) bhoopuram is explained as annamaya kosham, prithyathmakam (earth) praakaram, blessings and mind. thus a lofty yanthra is backed by very great philosophic principles. in short a yanthra is the true representation of the very universe itself with all its movable and immovable things within. according to sasthras, universe, kshetra and human body. all the three are fundamentally one and the same. if a human body is flattened on a flat surface hitting from the top we get a yanthra. everything in a yanthra can be found in a human body. every thing in a human body can be seen in a kshetra. everything in a great realisation and it leads to the truth that yanthra is universe itself.
Based on the purpose, yanthras drawn beejamanthras inscribed handed over to the benefactor to wear on his body after making it divine with proper poojas and observations. by wearing the yanthra,benefactor undergoes appreciable changes and finally he achieves the goal. it is not compulsory to wear the yanthra on body. to keep the yanthra in a sacred place and perform daily sadhana. this is enough to bring in the results.
So powerful and unique is an yanthra try to experiences its magic powers in your life. further i do pray to the almighty to shower blessings and appreciable experiences in your life following ‘yanthra ‘ path.
