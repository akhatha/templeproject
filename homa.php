Homa , is the act of showing reverence to a god, a spirit, or another aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers, songs, and rituals. 
An essential part of Homa for the Hindu devotee is making a spiritual connection with the divine. Most often that contact is facilitated through an object:
 an element of nature, a sculpture, a vessel, a painting, or a print.
<br>
<br>
It is possible to reduce the suffering due to the unfavorable position of planets through sincere reliance on God, the One who controls the planets.

 The malefic planetary conjunctions are the phases in one's life when one's aura gets darkened. Such a person is like one groping in the darkness.

 His thoughts and activities are misguided. The vibrations radiating from him displease others. 
<br><br>
The Indwelling Lord cannot turn a deaf ear to a soulful prayer said with an open heart. There are several homas which people can do for specific events,

 such as the starting of a business, or the beginning of a journey. The benefit of this type of puja is to remove obstacles. The pujas are performed 
 
 on behalf of those who request them by us. 
<br><br>
<strong>Benefits for doing pujas include</strong>: 
<br>

- Obtaining peace and happiness by getting rid of malefic forces. 
<br><br>
- Removing troubles that prevent us from starting on a spiritual path or business 
<br><br>
- Gaining material abundance, and spiritual prosperity. 
<br><br>
- Creating positive vibrations in the house, when starting new ventures such as a new job. 
<br><br>
- Removing obstacles if suffering from losses, when starting a new business or investments, when getting married. 
<br><br>
- Improving the general health of body and mind, for a speedy recovery from illness. 
<br><br>
- Increasing leadership skills, for increased courage and vital energy or to excel in martial arts. 
<br><br>
We can enhance the benefit of the puja by doing spiritual practices or by taking certain vows. Some of the commonly observed practices
 include meditation, fasting, silence, prayer, mantra japa or repeating God's name, charity. 
<br><br>
These vows can be done for one day, one week or as long as you wish. The result of these actions is to help purify us and to enable 
us to imbibe more deeply the spiritual energy invoked by the puja.
